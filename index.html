                        <p> I still dream about this website. Unforntaturly, this website is completely gone there is no evidence that it ever existed beyond the screenshots that float around on reddit and other socail media apps. 
                        Which means not even the best hackers on the planet can bring it back. Its been gone for oever a decade and still pains me to this very day. Milsberry walked so sites like webkinz, club peguin and roblox could run.</p>

                        <p> The amount of times someone has gaslight me over the exisitance of this particuler candy is crazy. Theyre real I promise. My tastebuds will forever reminise and crave the amzing mix of milk 
                           chocolete and cocnut. As a former, and still current candy addcit, nothing has come close to this. I dont even want Mars to bring them back because I know the new reciepe will be disrepctuful 
                           and belong in the trash. Absolutely a 10/10 candy. I dont even like coconut. Do not bother mentioning mounds or almond joys those belong in the trash too. </p>   </div>

                         <p>All I have to say is that I used to be able to grab 5 movies as a kid for only $1 and get them for a week. Compared to streaming prices today, it makes me want to scream
                           and I dont even pay for my streaming accounts. Current economic rants aside, I just dont get as much joy from opening netflix or HBOmax as I did going to blockbluster and renting my favorite 
                          bratz or barbie shows/movies. No streaming apps to this day has a good collection of 2000s movies/shows. RIP Blockbuster . you were a gem.</p>

                        <p> Another favorite time at school, not as good as field day tho. I had an amazing easer collection and it would of never been possible without the scholatic book fair and my parents money.
                           The amount of dopamine book fairs produced should really be studied. 10/10.</p>

                           miss seeing these types of stores for younger ages. This store is definity more for girly -girls, but there were more stores around that time tht catered to different personailities. You really

                        <p>Last but certainly not the least. They got rid of the opaque blue fruit snack. Terrible call on their end. Might as well just discontinue the whole product at this point. The ONE THING
                           that made this snack GOD-TEIR, they got rid of. I still see people to this day post about it on soical media. What a shame.... </p>
